				'PRODUKT is a multi-area brand selling everything from streetwear fashion to lifestyle goods and accessories. For the launch of the webshop, we defined a brand identity, designed logo and corporate guidelines, helped with the design and packaging of the products, organized and finalized photoshoots and developed the online store itself. The brand aims to grow their product range continuously. Therefore, we selected an easily manageable cms and designed the shopping-experience for the customer accordingly.'

			introduction:
				"This design proposal was developed as part of the visual identity development for a perfume start-up located in Germany. As part of this process we visualized multiple concepts for the client to decide which overall look suited their wishes and requirements best.\nDuring a very successfull launch in 2021 the perfume's first edition sold out in just 2 weeks - starting off the start-up finally branded as Soèm perfectly.\n\nThe process of brand identity development, which makes our work so enjoyable and special usually leaves us with great results that remain unseen. Therefore, we decided to use this space to showcase what is left on the cutting room floor."
