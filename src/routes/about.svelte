				MortimerBaltus is a 2021 founded partnership between art director Moritz and web developer
				Theo with the purpose of realizing holistic brand experiences by utilizing knowledge and
				techniques from different fields of profession. We work individually or as a team for
				agencies, companies and start up businesses. <br /> For our clients we aspire new concepts and
				favour the unconventional over the trend. This way we find individual solutions that can make
				lasting impressions in an otherwise boringly standardized world.
			</p>
			<p>
				Located in Hamburg and Tokyo we are able to work closely with our partners from both markets
				and can provide intercultural guidance if needed. We are always looking forward to get to
				know new people â€“ and Yes, we also speak Japanese.
